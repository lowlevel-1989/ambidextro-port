## What does this port include?

- **Launcher compatible with PortMaster** for automatic installation.  
- **Mod support** implemented using [Godot Mod Loader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader).  
- **Included mods:**
  - [**ShaderLow**](mods): a shader optimized specifically for handheld consoles, improving performance while preserving the gameâ€™s visual style.
  - [**Achievements**](mods): adds an in-game interface to track and view unlockable achievements, such as completing levels flawlessly, playing with both hands for a certain duration, or reaching specific scores.  
    This mod features its own save system, so achievements unlocked on the PC version will not carry over unless this same mod is enabled.
